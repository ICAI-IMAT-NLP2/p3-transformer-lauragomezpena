In the book, the Sword of the Stranger is a rather dull book. The book begins with a slashing of the sword and an arrow, and the book ends with a slashing of the sword, with the arrow going down and down. The book is a rather tedious book and the book ends with the book's final chapter being rewritten and revised. The book is a bit shorter. The book is an entertaining book for children .
